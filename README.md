# FastAC-go
The FastAC library written by Amir Said in 2005 and saved to the internet by Richard Geldreich in Go

I wrote this for fun from the hours of 4am to 7am on 4/24/2022, it's not fully finished nor is it tested at ALL but I might fix that later. Please enjoy an apt comparison of 2005 C++ to modern Go code, where you can see how I handled nasty pointer arithmetic in a (hopefully) clean manner

This is open to the public domain with no license atm but will likely be governed by a BSD or MIT style one later. 

I wrote this for a learning and educational experience to understand Arithmetic Codecs and Compression better, FastAC is a fantastic piece of work and also helped me to understand how to port C code to Go code better!
